                Job searching can be a stressful and daunting experience. But it
                doesn’t have to be that way.

            <p>
                Getting connected with
                <strong>the right people and the right places</strong> can make
                your job search easier and more exciting. This is where
                networking comes in.

                Networking gives you the best chance at landing a great
                stepping-stone opportunity in tech. Why? Because
                <strong>relationships matter</strong>. At its core, networking
                is about <strong>building good relationships</strong> in and
                around your industry. Those relationships often open new doors
                of opportunity.
            </p>

                Having a strong network allows you to get closer to people at
                the companies you’re interested in and showcases your
                credibility to potential employers, making you a more
                trustworthy candidate.
