            <h2>1. Get Close to the Right People</h2>
            <p>
                To break into tech, you need to connect with people and places
                already doing what you aspire to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by
                <strong
                    >connecting with your existing Millersville University
                    community</strong
                >. You’ll be amazed at how deeply connected Millersville
                University is in the tech world, bringing you closer to your
                dream job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Begin simply by connecting with
                <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/millersville-university/"
                    >Millersville University staff and alumni on LinkedIn</a
                >
                and engaging in Millersville University’s Slack channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                While building these connections, join networking groups. These
                groups offer a unique way to meet new people, ask
                behind-the-scenes questions, and hear about job openings—often
                before they’re posted online.
