            <h2>3. Be Direct and Put Yourself Out There</h2>
            <p>
                Feeling imposter syndrome when joining a networking group? Don’t
                let it hold you back. Be direct: share who you are, where you’re
                at in your journey, and what you hope to gain.
            </p>
            <p>
                People are willing to help if they understand your goals. Let
                them know what problem you’re solving in the marketplace so they
                remember your skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                An easy way to stand out is by
                <strong>posting your progress</strong>. Share projects and work
                you’re proud of on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and
                <a href="https://x.com">X</a> as you learn. Hiring managers
                often find talent online, so regular posts about your projects,
                excitement, and skills boost your visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> See this

                    >post by Deven McKay</a

                showcasing JavaScript skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Surround yourself with people doing
                what you want to do. Accountants won’t help you become an
                actor—connect with tech professionals to grow.
