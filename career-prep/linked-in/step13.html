            <h2>13. Giving/Receiving Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                A good recommendation carries significant weight. LinkedIn
                allows you to give and request recommendations displayed on your
                profile.

                <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>
                    Think of 2–3 people you admire and “Recommend” them. Then,
                    request recommendations from 2–3 trusted people who know
                    your character and work ethic (peers, past managers,
                    teachers).
                </p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <p><strong>Sample Recommendation Request:</strong></p>
                    <p>Hi {name},</p>
                    <p>
                        I hope everything’s going well at {work/location}! I’m
                        writing to ask if you’d be willing to write a LinkedIn
                        recommendation for me that highlights my {soft
                        skills/qualities/keywords e.g., Team player ability}.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ideally, if you could talk about your experience working
                        with me through {work/experience/event} at {location if
                        applicable}.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m working on {what you’re trying to accomplish e.g.,
                        New job} and a recommendation from you will
                        significantly help my profile show a focus {what you
                        want to be highlighted}.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I appreciate your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you,<br />{name}</p>
