            <h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://linkedin.com">Log into LinkedIn</a></li>

            <h2>1. Shorten Your Custom URL</h2>
            <p>
                It’s important to remove as many hoops and barriers as possible
                for people, including hiring managers and recruiters, to find
                you on LinkedIn. That starts with creating a short,
                easy-to-remember LinkedIn URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shorten your URL and you’ll have a simple, memorable link you
                can use on your resume, email signature, and easily share with
                friends and/or new networking contacts you make along the way.
