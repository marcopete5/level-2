            <h2>11. About = Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The About section is vital for showing hiring managers why
                you’re a good fit, and vice versa, in milliseconds. Use your
                resume’s summary to save time!

            <h3>About Example: Web Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Frontend Software Engineer with a proven ability to deliver
                quality results in both solo and collaborative settings. Prior
                to transitioning to software development, I led and championed
                training initiatives for Fortune 500 companies (i.e., Amazon,
                Home Depot) on best inclusive practices for people with
                disabilities, ultimately resulting in 2,000+ managers learning
                my techniques. The same passion I have for inclusivity and
                collaboration, I also have for software development. Embracing
                this passion led me to work through Millersville University’s
                coding bootcamp, which focused on JavaScript, React, and
                Node.js. I am now eager to apply these passions in obtaining a
                challenging position on a collaborative development team focused
                on creating high-quality, intuitive front-end applications.

                    DON’T use fancy words or jargon to sound smart. Speak in
                    Layman’s Terms so it’s clear and from the heart.
