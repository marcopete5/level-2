            <h2>12. Grow Your Connections</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you’ve made these targeted adjustments, it’s time to
                grow your connections! Get in proximity to the right people and
                places in tech.

                Start by connecting with the Millersville University Staff &
                Alumni community for a vast network to draw from during your job
                search. Then, branch out to past co-workers, friends, family,
                employees of tech companies, and people met at webinars or
                meetups.

                <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
                <p>
                    Resist clicking “Connect” with everyone. Instead, click
                    “Connect” then “Add a Note” for every request to reduce SPAM
                    and increase acceptance.

                        University and saw you speak at our event today. Thanks
                        for sharing. I really liked your time management ideas.
                        I’d love to connect with you here on LinkedIn!”</em
