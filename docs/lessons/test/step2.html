                    This section is to help you learn quickly the what, why, and
                    how of Unit testing.
                </p>
                <h3>What is unit testing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Unit testing is the practice of breaking your program into
                    smaller pieces and inspect each piece with tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tests run when changes are made to the code in your
                    projects. The more often you run your tests the better. This
                    helps you catch problems sooner and write better code.
                </p>
                <h3>Why should we be unit testing our code?</h3>
                <p>
                    When new developers hear of unit testing their first
                    thoughts are why? Doesn't this add more work and more code?
                    In reality, by making a test for each piece of application
                    we improve a number of things.
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        Makes your code easier to understand by forcing you to
                        write out the expected output of your program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Makes it easy to add new features. Normally when we add
                        new code we have to go through the application and make
                        sure it still works as it did before. Now we can simply
                        run are tests and have proof that it works as it did
                        before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Protects your code against other developers. By writing
                        out the way your program should behave if other
                        developers change your code they will see immediately
                        see when they break the application.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How?</h3>
                <p>
                    Many frameworks and tools exist to help developers easily
                    write and run unit tests. The frameworks we will be using to
                    write unit tests are Mocha and Chai.

                <h4>Mocha</h4>
                <p>
                    Mocha is a test runner. It's sole job is to look for (or be
                    told where to find) unit tests you've written, and to
                    execute them. It also displays in a nice, easy format to
                    show you how your unit tests faired - how many passed, how
                    many and which ones failed.
                </p>
                <h4>Chai</h4>
                <p>
                    Chai is an assertion library. Chai's libraries allow you to
                    choose exactly how your unit tests should read to a
                    developer. There are three libraries you get to choose from:
                    <strong>assert</strong>, <strong>expect</strong>, and
                    <strong>should</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of these libraries essentially do the same thing, just
                    with slightly different syntaxes. For simplicity, we're
                    going to use the <strong>assert</strong> library, but you
                    should definitely check out how tests are written in the
                    <strong>expect</strong> and
                    <strong>should</strong> libraries. (It's pretty nice,
                    because they read like English).
