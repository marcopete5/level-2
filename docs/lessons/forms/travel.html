                    You just started your own airline, and you need to create a
                    form to collect data about your passengers' upcoming travel
                    plans so they can book their flight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should collect the following information from the user:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>First name (text input)</li>
                    <li>Last name (text input)</li>
                    <li>Age (number input)</li>
                    <li>Gender (radio buttons with 2 or more options)</li>
                    <li>
                        Location they're traveling to (select box with at least
                        3 options. You're an airline that doesn't fly to many
                        places...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whether they have any dietary restrictions (check boxes
                        for vegetarian, kosher, lactose free, etc. Include at
                        least 3 options)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each element of the form should be given a
                    <code>name</code> attribute so you can access the data in
                    JavaScript and do stuff with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There should also be a button at the end of the form to
                    submit it. Upon pressing the button, an alert should pop up
                    that looks like this:
                </p>

                <p>Style the form to be user friendly and welcoming.</p>
