                    In this article we will be going over the basics of HTTP,
                    along with how information is passed around the web between
                    web servers and web browsers. This is important because a
                    program or website's ability to maintain information is due
                    to it being able to request and save information through a
                    server.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div
                class="section"
                id="http-and-protocols"

                    <strong>HTTP &amp; Protocols</strong>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    HTTP stands for
                    <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>. Protocols are
                    rules, so HTTP is the set of rules used to govern how web
                    browsers and web servers communicate and exchange
                    information on the web.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Whenever you make a request on the web, it always begins
                        with&nbsp;http&nbsp;as that is the protocol being used
                        to request the website you are visiting.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <div
                class="section"
                id="ip-address"
                aria-labelledby="ip-address-heading">
                <h3 id="ip-address-heading"><strong>IP Address</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    If HTTP defines the protocols for transferring data across
                    the web, how does a web server know which computer to send
                    information to once it receives a request?
                </p>

                <p>
                    IP addresses are the unique identifier that each computer
                    has. Since the IP address is specific and unique on each
                    computer, servers sending data across the web know where to
                    send information when a request comes in. This is how you
                    are able to go to www.google.com, and google knows to send
                    it's homepage to you on your specific system.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        An IP address is specified by 4 numbers separated by 3
                        periods. The numbers can range from 0 - 255. Ex:
                        192.5.48.102
                    </p>

                    <strong>Servers and APIs</strong>
                </h3>

                <h4><strong>Servers</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    When you are developing an application, you will frequently
                    be interacting with servers to retrieve and save data. These
                    servers would be referred to as
                    <strong>remote servers</strong>, as they may be thousands of
                    miles away or just in the other room.<strong
                        >Local servers</strong
                    >
                    on the other hand refers to when you are running a server on
                    your personal computer. When you are developing an
                    application with a server, you will have to run that server
                    locally on your system in order to get data from your
                    database.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whenever you visit a website, you are making a request to a
                    server (such as typing in amazon.com and pressing
                    <code>enter</code>). That request is saying, "Hey server,
                    I'd like to checkout some new boots on amazon.com, could you
                    load their homepage for me please?". Alright so maybe it's
                    not so informal, but this is the essence of what is
                    happening.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The server's job is to <em>listen</em> for requests (such as
                    a request to visit amazon.com), and eventually send back the
                    data for the user to view. With certain node modules,
                    building a basic server is almost as easy as typing
                    <code>server.listen()</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So ask yourself, "if it's the server's job to
                    <em>listen</em> for requests and then send that information
                    back once it has it, what code handles taking the request
                    from the user and actually getting the appropriate data?"
                </p>

                <h4><strong>API</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    When a server receives a request (such as to load
                    amazon.com's homepage to find some fancy new boots), there
                    is code written in that server that handles the specific
                    type of request. The code that handles all the different
                    types of requests coming into the server is called an API
                    (Application Programming Interface).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the example of visiting amazon to buy boots, the
                    server would receive the <em>request</em> to load the home
                    page, and the API would then handle getting the data for
                    that home page. The server would then send the information
                    back to the user in the form of a <em>response</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This process is often referred to as the
                    <code>request</code> - <code>response</code> cycle. A
                    diagram of this is shown below:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img
                        class="image-embed-inline"
                        src="https://d186loudes4jlv.cloudfront.net/http/images/http_client_server.png"
                        alt="Client-server request/response diagram"
                        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto" />
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this image, the request is coming from the client (your
                    PC), and the response is going to the client from the web
                    server. The initial <em>request</em> would be for the
                    homepage, but when you click on 'boots', you are sending a
                    request to now load the page that has all them fancy boots
                    on it. This would follow the same <em>request</em> -
                    <em>response</em> cycle to go get the data for boots, and
                    send it back so you can view it on your system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we make requests to a server, we will be receiving the
                    response in the form of JSON data so that you can use it in
                    your applications. We will go deeper into servers and APIs
                    later in the course when you will learn how to build your
                    own, but having a high level understanding of these terms
                    will help you grasp concepts as we begin interacting with
                    servers!
