                    Using AJAX, do a GET request to your own Github repositories
                    endpoint. The URL will be
                    <code
                        >https://api.github.com/users/&lt;YOUR GITHUB USERNAME

                <p>
                    Once you get the data, use <code>.reduce()</code> to figure
                    out how many <code>watchers</code> you have across all of
                    your repositories. Don't be too disappointed if the number
                    is 0. You're still new at this :)

                    <strong>Note:</strong> If you've learned how to use the
                    <code>axios</code> library, you can do this in node.
                    Otherwise, you'll want to run this code in the browser's
                    JavaScript context and either use
                    <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or jQuery's AJAX methods,
                    meaning you'll need an HTML page and an associated script
